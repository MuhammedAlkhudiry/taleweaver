# TaleWeaver

This is a work-in-progress WYSIWYG editor aiming to become the word processor for the 2Tale platform. The goal is to develop an editor that is fully aware of where things are rendered, and completely avoid the use of contenteditable.

The project is broken up into various modules:

- Model
- Cursor
- State
- View

See README of each module for further detail.
