# TaleWeaver

This is a work-in-progress web-based word processor for the [2Tale Writer's Portal](https://writer.2tale.com/). The goal is to develop a layout-aware WYSIWYG editor that does not rely on the browser for line breaking, cursor placement and input event capturing. Most existing open-source editors use contenteditable to delegate these responsibilities to the browser, as a result, it is difficult to implement features on top of them that require layout information. Such features include multiple cursor placement for collaborative editing, word processor style fixed-sized pages, and complex UI overlays on top of the document such as commenting and highlighting.
